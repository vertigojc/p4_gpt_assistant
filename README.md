# p4_gpt_assistant
This is mostly just a fun, silly project. 

The script can be setup on a crontab or scheduled task and will check the p4 changelist history since it was last run, and use openai to generate a summary message to send to the team on Discord. It is still a work in progress and mostly just for fun, but it could be interesting to expand it into a more full-fledged Discord bot where you can ask it questions about your server and it will know how to do a limited number of things on the server (most likely just read-only operations, to avoid any catastrophes! ðŸ˜…)
